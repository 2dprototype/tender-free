// Create a new ZIP archive
writer := zip.writer()
writer.create("hello.txt", "hello world")
writer.set_comment("this is a comment!")
writer.close()

io.writefile("hello.zip", writer.bytes())

// Reading ZIP
reader := zip.reader(io.readfile("hello.zip"))

for file in reader.files {
	println(file.read())
}
```
